# CRUD Project README

This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) project implemented in Java. It allows you to manage customer records using a text-based user interface through JOptionPane dialogs. The project uses a basic Customer class and an interface for customer data access (ICustomerDAO), with a specific implementation using a CustomerMapDAO.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adekanbipedro/BackEnd_CRUD.git
Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.

Compile and run the App.java file to start the CRUD application.

## Usage
The application provides a simple text-based menu through JOptionPane dialogs. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the system. You can perform the following actions:

Register: Add a new customer to the database.
Show: Retrieve and display customer information based on their ID.
Delete: Remove a customer from the database (not implemented in this code).
Change: Update customer information (not implemented in this code).
Exit: Quit the application.

## Functionality
Here's a brief overview of the code structure and functionality:

The Customer class represents customer information and is used to create customer objects.
The ICustomerDAO interface defines the contract for data access operations.
The CustomerMapDAO class provides an implementation of the data access operations using a map-based data store.
The App class contains the main method and user interface logic, allowing users to interact with the CRUD operations via JOptionPane dialogs.
You can easily extend the functionality by implementing additional methods in the ICustomerDAO interface and providing corresponding implementations.
